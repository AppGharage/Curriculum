## Introduction
Want to learn how to develop Web applications? This is a curriculum AppGharage has developed to train and vet it's developers. If you are confused as to what to learn or how to become a Web Developer, this Curriculum should serve as a guide and help you not follow trendy tools and stacks.

The Curriculum includes projects which would help you validate what you learn. We truly believe that, should you follow and complete the projects in this curriculum, you will have the skills to call yourself a World Class Web Developer :metal: 

::: warning IMPORTANT
Donâ€™t let the curriculum scare you. You by no means need to understand everything on this curriculum to become a great Web developer. Instead, use this as a guide.

Understanding these tools and knowing when to use them is very key to your growth as a Developer.

It's advisable to practice what you learn by building mini projects. It doesn't have to be something a lot of people will use.

## Problem Solving & Research 

::: tip
Solving problems is the core of computer science. Programmers must first understand how a human solves a problem, then understand how to translate this "algorithm" into something a computer can do, and finally how to "write" the specific syntax (required by a computer) to get the job done.
